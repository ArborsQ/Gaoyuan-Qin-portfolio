## Hi hi,  This is Gaoyuan Qin!

I'm a undergraduate student in Software Engineering at **Swinburne University of Technology**, currently conducting research on AI-powered traffic flow prediction and medical automation devices.  

Previously, I worked as a research assistant at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/),advised by Prof. [Mengyue Wu](https://myw19.github.io/) in [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/). With a focus on mental health applications of large language models.  and I also worked in the Software Technology Laboratory of Shandong University of Science and Technology for a period of time, advised by Prof. [Guoqiang Ren](https://jnxq.sdust.edu.cn/info/1251/21325.htm)

I will join [Tencent Cloud](https://cloud.tencent.com/) as a product manage.  I am very interested in how technology products affect people's daily lives!
